An A-record is an entry in your DNS zone file that maps each domain name (e.g. yourdomain.com) or subdomain (e.g. subdomain.yourdomain.com) to an IP address. In other words, the A-record specifies the IP address to which the user would be sent for each domain or subdomain. This means that you can have different subdomains of your website resolving to different IP addresses, which could be useful if they are hosted on different servers.


Hi Dhrumil

 The "A" record is pointing to our production server.

The CName entry for "www" is pointing to another IP address (64.30.224.112).

You will have to change it so that it points to "A record" (i.e cleaneats.com) from your domain management panel.

I will have to change my Apache configuration file once you make those changes.

Thanks



Prashant after having a look at AR 2.3 and AR 3.0 it looks like you were actually tapping some internal code.

Essentially actions with callbacks were alias_method_chained with :callbacks so part of a save would be to do callbacks then call *_without_callbacks (update_without_callbacks in your case).

The callback chain in AR3 eventually comes from ActiveSupport::Callbacks.CallbackChain which inherits from Array. I would say then that you *should* be able to call .clear on your _update_callbacks OR for each callback you want to remove using the above filtering just call .delete on the CallbackChain object.

Checkout the ActiveSupport::Callbacks module to dig a bit deeper.

Cheers
