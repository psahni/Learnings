USE OF S3 WITH PAPERCLIP


Select all users that have entries in request table
SELECT u.userID, u.lastname, u.firstname
FROM User u
WHERE userID IN (SELECT userID FROM Request)

-- again, select all users that have entries in request table
SELECT u.userID, u.lastname, u.firstname
FROM User u
WHERE EXISTS
(
SELECT *
FROM Request
WHERE userID=u.userID
)

Plus, you could use a join, too:

SELECT DISTINCT u.userID, u.lastname, u.firstname
FROM User u, Request r
WHERE r.userID=u.userID

But, note the use of DISTINCT here. Without it, you will get multiple records for users with more than 1 request. The cost of DISTINCT is pretty high, so that alternative is usually slower than EXISTS.
